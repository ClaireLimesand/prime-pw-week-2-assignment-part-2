// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a string variable called name and set it to Dane.
// We create a conditional. We check if name is Mary. If it is we console.log 'Hi, Mary!'
// If name is anything other than Mary, we console.log 'How do you do?'
// we console.log 'How do you do?' (because name is Dane, not Mary)

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called secret. It will be declared using the following steps:
// We create a number variable called code. code is set to 123.
// We check if code is equal to 123. If it is than our variant 'secret' is super and our variant code is multiplied by 2.
// We check if code is greater than 250. If it is than our 'secret' variant is duper.
// Code IS equal to 123, so secret = super and code = 246. code (246) is NOT greater than 250 therefore it is not duper.
// We console.log 'super'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//We create a boolean variable called 'isStudent' and set it to true.
//We create two number variables: 'age' and 'zip' and set them to 34 and 55407, respectively.
//We check if 'isStudent' is true and 'zip' is >8000. If so we console.log `You're a student on the West Coast!'
//If that's false, we check if 'isStudent' is false and 'age' is <30. If so we console.log 'What are your hobbies?'
//If that too is false, we check if 'isStudent' is true. If so we console.log 'Welcome to Prime!'
//Lastly, if none of the above cases are true, we console.log 'How about the weater?'
//In this case, we console log 'Welcome to Prime!'
//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;
//FIX instructions say colorOne is blue and colorTwo is red. It is reversed
//should be let colorOne = 'blue'; let colorTwo = 'red';

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
//FIX it says both should be set to 'purple' but here it is only colorOne
//should be if (mix === true) { colorOne = 'purple'; colorTwo = purple; }
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
//FIX instructions say to check temp AND time but this uses || which means OR
//should be if (temp > 39 && time >= 4)
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
}
//FIX this works, but the instructions ask if age>=minAge this does the reverse
//should be:
//if(age >= minAge) {
    console.log('enter');
  } else {
    console.log('no entry');
  }
